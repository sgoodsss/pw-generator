# Random Password Generator

## Description

Everyone knows how frustrating it is when you need to choose a new password and can't seem to come up with a complex one on your own!  I built this webpage so that my users can generate passwords with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers.  Through building this project, I learned how to manipulate variables, store arrays in variables, combining variables, and overall gained more experience using JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Click on the "Generate Password" button.  The user will be prompted to enter their desired password length between 8 and 128 characters.  Then, the user will confirm whether or not they would like to use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers.  Their generated password will be displayed in the text box on the browser.

## Credits
On 7/18/2023, I had a one hour tutoring session with Savien Love.  She helped answer my questions on how to format my functions, create empty variables, and how to combine variables.  The rest of the resources I used are listed below:
